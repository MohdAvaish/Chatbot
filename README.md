# Chatbot
Creating a chatbot project using AI involves building a conversational system capable of understanding user queries and responding appropriately. Here's a high-level plan with source code for a simple chatbot built using Python and a machine learning-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) library.
Project Plan: AI Chatbot
Features
1.Intent Recognition: Understands user queries based on intents.
2.Predefined Responses: Provides responses based on recognized intents.
3.Extensible: Easy to add more intents and responses.
4.Interactive Console: A simple console-based interface.
Technologies
(i).Python: Programming language.
(ii).NLTK / spaCy: For text processing.
(iii).TensorFlow / PyTorch: For training models (if advanced).
(iv).Flask/Django: To deploy the chatbot as a web application (optional).
